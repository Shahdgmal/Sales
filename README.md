## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends to:

- Reduce customer churn rate by identifying key factors influencing attrition.
- Optimize product offerings by determining top-selling products and their performance across different regions.
- Enhance customer segmentation by analyzing demographics (age, gender, occupation) to improve targeted marketing strategies.
- Evaluate sales performance by tracking order quantities, discounts, and revenue trends over time


## Key Questions (KPIs)

### Customer Analysis:

- What is the current churn rate, and which customer segments are most affected?
- How does occupation influence customer retention?
- Which age groups and genders represent the largest customer base?
- Who are the top 10 customers by sales, and what patterns can be observed?

### Product Analysis:

- What is the distribution of product statuses (current vs. canceled)?
- Which products have the highest order quantities and sales revenue?
- How does order quantity vary by country?
- What is the trend in order quantity and discount amounts over time?

### Sales & Performance:

- How do sales differ between corporate and home office segments?
- Which geographical markets (US, Australia, Canada, etc.) contribute most to sales?
- Are there seasonal or yearly trends in product demand?

## Project Insights
### Customer Insights:
- Churn Rate: 25.57% (4,726 out of 18K customers), indicating a significant attrition issue.

- Top Occupations: Professionals (5.5K) and Skilled Manual workers (4.6K) dominate the customer base.

- Gender Distribution: Nearly equal (49.41% Male, 50.59% Female).

- Age Groups: Majority are under 50, with a smaller but notable segment aged 50-70 (14.22%).


### Product Insights:
- Product Status: 67% of products are current, while 33% are canceled, suggesting potential inventory or demand issues.

- Geographical Sales: The United States has the highest order quantity (21K), followed by Australia (13K).

- Time Trends: Order quantities peaked in 2010 (60K), with fluctuations in later years.

### Sales & Segmentation Insights:
- Corporate vs. Home Office: Corporate customers make up 36.94%, while home office accounts for 63.06%.

- Discount Impact: Discount strategies may need optimization, as high discounts do not always correlate with increased sales.


## Final Conclusion 
### Key Takeaways:
- The 25.57% churn rate is concerning, Focus on high-risk groups (e.g., skilled manual workers, older demographics) with loyalty programs.

- Expand high-demand products (e.g., Mountain-200 series, water bottles).

- Review canceled products (33%) to identify supply chain or demand issues.

- Target corporate clients (36.94%) more aggressively, as they represent a significant but underutilized segment.
